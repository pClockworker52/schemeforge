# Tasks for WSL A (OpenCourant simulations)

Procedure: [../coldspray-procedure.md](../coldspray-procedure.md). Pull `claude/exciting-fermi-qy077p`, do the
newest open task, push results to `coldspray/opencourant-sph`. Write only your own section of
opencourant-verification.md and your own scripts and results. Do not edit STATUS, HANDOFF, DECISIONS, the hunch
files or this file. Blind-list papers stay closed.

## Task 2026-11-05-a: CS-13b (open)

Protocol: [../coldspray-hunch-cs13b.md](../coldspray-hunch-cs13b.md), frozen in commit 9a36aae. Follow it exactly and
in this order:

1. **Rung H0-SPH.** The H0 slab of §11.2 built from SPH particles (cubic net, §9.1 settings), with conduction,
   against erfc at t = 10 ns. Pass: within 2 % at the finest spacing, with the temperature written out. If it fails,
   the particle stays adiabatic, as the protocol says, and you continue.
2. **The 24 runs.**
   - Setup F as frozen in §10.2; 500, 800 and 1100 m/s; R/16, R/24, R/32 and R/48.
   - Each case adiabatic and conductive. Conduction in the bricks, and in the particle only if H0-SPH passed.
   - Contact adiabatic: no heat across TYPE7.
   - Budget stop: if one R/48 run takes more than 1 h, stop and report before the rest.
3. **Metrics, as defined in the protocol:**
   - P1: t_f;
   - P2: maximum substrate edge plastic strain within 1.17 µm of the contact edge, at t_c = 0.5 × the smallest t_f
     at that velocity;
   - P3: conductive minus adiabatic, reported only;
   - P0: comparison with the §10.5 values, reported only;
   - also report which element controls each run's stop (a brick or a particle).
4. **Apply the frozen verdict rule exactly as written,** including the adiabatic-twin control and the 6 % tolerance
   for R/32 → R/48.

Results go in opencourant-verification.md **§12**. A failed rung or an impossible step goes to Peter, as before.
